    "beaver sign, sediment depth, and the stranded hulks of fence posts from "
    "farms abandoned in the forties. The third summer was all reconciliation: "
    "duplicate plots resolved, disputed species calls sent to the herbarium, "
    "and the great argument over whether the channel had truly migrated or "
    "merely braided settled by an afternoon with the 1962 aerial photographs. "
